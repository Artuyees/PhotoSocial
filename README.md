An Instagram clone made with react, Tailwind CSS and Supabase.
Features:
- Magic-link authorisation
- Images are being stored on supabase
- User avatar can be updated.
- responsive design
- Adding posts functionality
- Adding stories functionality
- Posts can be liked by each user
- I didn't know how to use Redux or Recoil while making this. I also had no idea that Context API existed so props passing in this project is bad, tragic to be honest. ðŸ™…

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
